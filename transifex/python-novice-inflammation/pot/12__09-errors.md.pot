"title: Errors and Exceptions\n"
"teaching: 30\n"
"exercises: 0\n"
"questions:\n"
"- \"How does Python report errors?\"\n"
"- \"How can I handle errors in Python programs?\"\n"
"objectives:\n"
"- \"To be able to read a traceback, and determine where the error took place and what type it is.\"\n"
"- \"To be able to describe the types of situations in which syntax errors,\n"
"   indentation errors, name errors, index errors, and missing file errors occur.\"\n"
"keypoints:\n"
"- \"Tracebacks can look intimidating, but they give us a lot of useful information about\n"
"   what went wrong in our program, including where the error occurred and\n"
"   what type of error it was.\"\n"
"- \"An error having to do with the 'grammar' or syntax of the program is called a `SyntaxError`.\n"
"   If the issue has to do with how the code is indented,\n"
"   then it will be called an `IndentationError`.\"\n"
"- \"A `NameError` will occur when trying to use a variable that does not exist. Possible causes are\n"
"  that a variable definition is missing, a variable reference differs from its definition\n"
"  in spelling or capitalization, or the code contains a string that is missing quotes around it.\"\n"
"- \"Containers like lists and strings will generate errors if you try to access items\n"
"   in them that do not exist. This type of error is called an `IndexError`.\"\n"
"- \"Trying to read a file that does not exist will give you an `FileNotFoundError`.\n"
"   Trying to read a file that is open for writing, or writing to a file that is open for reading,\n"
"   will give you an `IOError`.\"\n"
