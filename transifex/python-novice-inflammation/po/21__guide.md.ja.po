msgid "This lesson is written as an introduction to Python,\n"
"but its real purpose is to introduce the single most important idea in programming:\n"
"how to solve problems by building functions,\n"
"each of which can fit in a programmer's working memory.\n"
"In order to teach that,\n"
"we must teach people a little about\n"
"the mechanics of manipulating data with lists and file I/O\n"
"so that their functions can do things they actually care about.\n"
"Our teaching order tries to show practical uses of every idea as soon as it is introduced;\n"
"instructors should resist the temptation to explain\n"
"the \"other 90%\" of the language\n"
"as well."

msgid "The final example asks them to build a command-line tool\n"
"that works with the Unix pipe-and-filter model.\n"
"We do this because it is a useful skill\n"
"and because it helps learners see that the software they use isn't magical.\n"
"Tools like `grep` might be more sophisticated than\n"
"the programs our learners can write at this point in their careers,\n"
"but it's crucial they realize this is a difference of scale rather than kind."
