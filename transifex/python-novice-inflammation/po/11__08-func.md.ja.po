"title: Creating Functions\n"
"teaching: 30\n"
"exercises: 0\n"
"questions:\n"
"- \"How can I define new functions?\"\n"
"- \"What's the difference between defining and calling a function?\"\n"
"- \"What happens when I call a function?\"\n"
"objectives:\n"
"- \"Define a function that takes parameters.\"\n"
"- \"Return a value from a function.\"\n"
"- \"Test and debug a function.\"\n"
"- \"Set default values for function parameters.\"\n"
"- \"Explain why we should divide programs into small, single-purpose functions.\"\n"
"keypoints:\n"
"- \"Define a function using `def function_name(parameter)`.\"\n"
"- \"The body of a function must be indented.\"\n"
"- \"Call a function using `function_name(value)`.\"\n"
"- \"Numbers are stored as integers or floating-point numbers.\"\n"
"- \"Variables defined within a function can only be seen and used within the body of the function.\"\n"
"- \"If a variable is not defined within the function it is used,\n"
"   Python looks for a definition before the function call\"\n"
"- \"Use `help(thing)` to view help for something.\"\n"
"- \"Put docstrings in functions to provide help for that function.\"\n"
"- \"Specify default values for parameters when defining a function using `name=value`\n"
"   in the parameter list.\"\n"
"- \"Parameters can be passed by matching based on name, by position,\n"
"   or by omitting them (in which case the default value is used).\"\n"
"- \"Put code whose parameters change frequently in a function,\n"
"   then call it with different parameter values to customize its behavior.\"\n"
